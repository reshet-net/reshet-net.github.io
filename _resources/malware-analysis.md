# Books

- [Practical Malware Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Malware-Analysis-Hands-Dissecting/dp/1593272901/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=practical+malware+analysis&qid=1594689921&sr=8-3): While slightly dated, it is one of the best introductions to the topic. The hardest part is finding Windows XP licenses and older program versions for the virtual machine. To help get started with the search: older system utilities such as `strings` can be found [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20051207015816/http://www.sysinternals.com/) and OllyDbg can be found [here](http://www.ollydbg.de/). If you're having trouble finding a Windows XP license or an older program version, reach out to me and I'll do my best to help.
